# Uoft Literacy Experiment

Inspired by MIT's Wanderverse project where students complete a poem by flipping through random pages on the campus libraries. 

I want to learn more technologies, particularly React, Django, or other popular frontend frameworks. 
Particularly a challenge would be figuring out which books are in the libraries. Building a web scraper for the library can be added. 
I also want to learn relational databases (SQL) to store book data, users, and poems created

Goals:
- add 3d model to it eventually
- learn django
- learn sql
